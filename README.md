# MIT 6.00.1x Problem Sets

Computational devices have become so pervasive that most of the time we do not even realise we are using them. Computation keeps our planes in the air, our cars on the road, it manages our electrical, communications and financial systems - it can control everything from homes to pacemakers. Computation has changed the way people think about the world.

MIT 6.00.1x teaches core programming concepts and techniques using Python to solve complex problems. The course lasts 7 weeks and acts as a stepping stone to more advanced computer science courses.

## Week 1 - Computation and Python Basics

Machines. Languages. Types. Variables. Operators. Branching. Bindings. I/O. IDEs. Control Flow. Loops. Iteration.

## Week 2 - Simple Programs

Bisection Search. Floats. Functions. Scope. Specifications. Docstrings. Decomposition. Abstraction. Recursion. 

## Week 3 - Structured Programs

Arrays. Lists. Tuples. Sets. Dictionaries. Hashtables. Higher Order Programming.

## Week 4 - Good Programming Practices

Testing and Debugging. Exceptions and Assertions.

## Week 5 - Object Oriented Programming

Classes. Objects. Methods. Inheritence. Polymorphism. Encapsulation. Abstraction.

## Week 6 - Algorithmic Complexity

Computational Complexity. Searching and Sorting Algorithms. 

## Week 7 - 
(TBC)
